## Build your adapter

This adapter is designed to works with a D1 Mini (ESP8266) but it provides convenient header pins to use it with any other uController.

It is designed by Palazzetti using a Si8621 (Silicon Labs Isolator) to provide electrical isolation between uController and Stove electronic.  
This design uses exact same schematic and components.

### Schematic
